Started using [Atom][atom] on Linux a little bit. Oddly it seems to break from time to time. When trying to open files it will give a nasty error. This is a quik fix.

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/.atom/storage
find . -type f -delete
{% endhighlight %}


Another issue that might happen. `Unable to watch path: keymap.cson. Make sure you have permission to read /home/anders/.atom/keymap.cson.` Type this in the terminal. If it works read this [git post][atom1] about troubleshooting.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=32768
{% endhighlight %}
